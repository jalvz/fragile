The Elephant Song (sort of)

An elephant stood on the web of a spider
She felt it was strong, it couldnâ€™t be tighter
Along came her friend, she called to invite her...

2 elephants stood on the web of a spider...
3 elephants stood on the web of a spider...
4 elephants stood on the web of a spider...
5 elephants stood on the web of a spider...
6 elephants stood on the web of a spider...
